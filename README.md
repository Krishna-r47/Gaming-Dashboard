-> To make the dashboard feel more interactive, a central theme with more colour was chosen to relate with gaming. KPI's are highlighted at the top. A gaming-themed map to indicate each of the 4 regions and their sales (info in tooltip), bubble chart to understand sales in each genre, animated bubble chart to show evolution of interest in different gaming genres and top selling games are all part of this dashboard. Legend is only present on the top to reduce repetition and efficiently use data-ink ratio.

-> While the previous dashboard concentrated on region and genre, this dashboard focuses on the publishers and platform. An area chart for plotting the revenue trend of top 5 grossing publishers, a lollipop chart to compare and contrast game-to-sales ratio for the top 5 publishers, a heatmap to highlight performance of consoles with respect to different genres and a line chart ranking sales performances for top 5 publishers over time are all present here. Since the legend is only present at the top of the dashboard, a creative decision was taken to place the charts in such a way that each plot acts as a reference to the one next to it.
